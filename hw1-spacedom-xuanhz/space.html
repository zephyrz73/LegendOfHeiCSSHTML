            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

        <h2>Far Out Facts</h2>
        <p>
          There are far too many interesting facts about space than humanly possible to list.

            <span class="underline">Crop circles</span> began as a phenomenon of
            the English countryside, then spread to the far corners of the onetime
            British Empire (Australia, Canada) after World War II, when the U.K.
            was falling unmistakably back in the ranks of nations and when its
            provincial subjects would have felt some understandable desire to
            demonstrate that, somehow, their lives really mattered.
            <span class="underline">American encounters were invariably rural

            country’s interior and the deserts and mountains of the West,
            in decades the country as a whole spent rapidly urbanizing and
            then industrializing its farmland so systematically it looked
            like Monsanto was trying to exterminate the American farmer along
            with the cotton bollworm.

          <h2>Three Reasons</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>The Government Admitted It’s Taking UFOs Seriously</h3>
              <details>
                  <p>
                    In 1952, a CIA group called <em>the Psychological
                    Strategy Board</em> concluded that, when it came to
                    UFOs, the American public was dangerously gullible
                    and prone to “hysterical mass behavior.”
                  </p>
              </details>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>More Possibilites</h3>
              <details>
                <p>
                  Just 30 years ago, we had not discovered a single planet
                  outside our solar system. Now <time> 2020 </time> we know
                  of more than <mark>3,000</mark> of them, and we know nearly
                  every star in the night sky has at least one planet in its
                  orbit.
                </p>
            </details>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Habitable Planet</h3>
              <details>
                <p>
                  Scientists now think every one in five or six planets
                  might be habitable, based on two general criteria:
                  They’re rocky, and they reside in a region of the
                  star’s orbit called the <em>“Goldilocks zone,” </em>
                  where it’s not too cold and not too hot, but just right
                  to allow for liquid water to form on the surface. And
                  where there’s water, there can be life.
